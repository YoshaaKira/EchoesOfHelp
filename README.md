# EchoesOfHelp
### Project Title: **Echoes of Help**

#### **Project Overview**:
"Echoes of Help" is an atmospheric puzzle-adventure game where players must navigate through 10 increasingly challenging underground levels. The game utilizes sound as the primary mechanic for exploration and puzzle-solving. Players use their voice to send out sound waves that interact with the environment, but louder sounds will also attract dangerous monsters lurking in the darkness. The ultimate goal is to solve puzzles, collect keys, and ascend through all levels to reach the surface.

#### **Core Mechanics**:

1. **Voice-Based Sound Waves**:
   - **Omnidirectional Waves**: Loud noises send sound waves in all directions, illuminating the entire level but also alerting nearby monsters to the player's presence.
   
2. **Puzzle Solving**:
   - Each of the 10 underground levels contains a unique puzzle, ranging from logic-based challenges to sound-based interactions with the environment.
   - Successfully solving a puzzle rewards the player with a key, unlocking the door to the next level.

3. **Progressive Difficulty**:
   - As players advance through the levels, the puzzles become more complex, and the threat from monsters increases, requiring greater strategy in managing sound waves and stealth.

4. **Monsters and Stealth**:
   - Monsters are highly sensitive to sound. Players must decide when to risk louder sound waves to reveal their surroundings or solve puzzles, knowing that it could attract nearby threats.
   - Players can use quieter sound waves to stay undetected, but with limited visibility, making navigation more challenging.

#### **Game Objective**:
The goal of "Echoes of Help" is to make it through all 10 underground levels, solve the puzzles, and reach the surface. Players must balance the need for exploration with the risk of attracting monsters by managing the volume of their voice as they progress through increasingly difficult levels.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Innovative Sound-Based Gameplay**: Players use their real voice to interact with the environment and navigate the game, creating a unique and immersive experience.
- **Challenging Puzzles**: Each level presents a unique puzzle, requiring critical thinking and clever use of sound to solve.
- **Stealth and Survival**: Players must be mindful of their surroundings and manage how much sound they make, as louder noises will attract monsters.
- **Atmospheric Setting**: The game features dark, mysterious underground levels where sound is the only way to "see" the environment, enhancing the tension and immersion.

#### **Why It Stands Out**:
This game concept stands out in its use of voice as both a tool and a liability. The balance between using sound for puzzle-solving while risking detection by monsters adds a layer of tension and strategy. The gradual difficulty curve, along with the climactic goal of reaching the surface, provides a rewarding progression for players.

#### **Technology Stack**:
- **Game Engine**: Unity (for real-time sound propagation, voice input, and environment rendering).
- **Voice Recognition**: Integration with voice recognition APIs to detect the player's input volume and trigger sound waves accordingly.
  
#### **Target Audience**:
This game is designed for players who enjoy puzzle-solving, exploration, and immersive, atmospheric experiences. The voice control mechanic adds a fresh layer of innovation, appealing to gamers seeking new and interactive gameplay.
